-- DEBUG LOGIN ISSUE
-- =====================================================
-- Run these queries to diagnose why login is failing
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: Check if clinic exists in clinics table
-- =====================================================
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email,
  password IS NOT NULL as has_password,
  password as password_value,  -- See actual password
  is_active,
  subscription_status,
  created_at
FROM clinics
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: Should see your newly created clinic with email and password

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: Check if auth user exists
-- =====================================================
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  encrypted_password IS NOT NULL as has_encrypted_password,
  email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL as email_confirmed,
  created_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE email IN (
  SELECT email FROM clinics WHERE email IS NOT NULL
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Expected: May be empty - this is OK for clinic-only login

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: Check specific clinic by email
-- =====================================================
-- Replace 'clinic@example.com' with actual email you're trying to login with

SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email,
  password,
  is_active,
  subscription_status,
  created_at
FROM clinics
WHERE email = 'limitlessbrainlab@gmail.com';  -- 👈 CHANGE THIS to your email

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 4: Check if password matches
-- =====================================================
-- This checks if the password you're entering matches database

SELECT
  email,
  password as stored_password,
  CASE
    WHEN password = 'YourPasswordHere' THEN '✅ PASSWORD MATCHES'  -- 👈 CHANGE THIS
    ELSE '❌ PASSWORD DOES NOT MATCH'
  END as password_check,
  is_active
FROM clinics
WHERE email = 'limitlessbrainlab@gmail.com';  -- 👈 CHANGE THIS

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 5: Count clinics with and without passwords
-- =====================================================
SELECT
  'Total Clinics' as category,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM clinics

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'Clinics with Password',
  COUNT(*)
FROM clinics
WHERE password IS NOT NULL AND password != ''

UNION ALL

  COUNT(*)
FROM clinics
WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND email != ''

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'Active Clinics',
  COUNT(*)
FROM clinics
WHERE is_active = true;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 6: List all clinics with auth status
-- =====================================================
SELECT
  c.name,
  c.email,
  c.password IS NOT NULL as has_password,
  c.is_active,
  c.subscription_status,
  u.id IS NOT NULL as has_auth_user,

-- DIAGNOSIS GUIDE
-- =====================================================

/*
CASE 1: Clinic exists but password is NULL
Solution: Update password
UPDATE clinics SET password = 'YourPassword123' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

CASE 2: Clinic exists but is_active = false
Solution: Activate clinic
UPDATE clinics SET is_active = true WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

CASE 3: Clinic doesn't exist at all
Solution: Clinic creation failed. Check browser console for errors during creation.

CASE 4: Password doesn't match
Solution: Either:
- You're entering wrong password
- Or reset password: UPDATE clinics SET password = 'NewPassword123' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

CASE 5: Email mismatch (case sensitive)
Solution: Check exact email format in database
*/

-- =====================================================
-- COMMON FIXES
-- =====================================================

-- FIX 1: Set password for clinic (if missing)
/*
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'Password123'  -- 👈 Set your desired password
WHERE email = 'limitlessbrainlab@gmail.com';  -- 👈 Your clinic email
*/

-- FIX 2: Activate clinic (if inactive)
/*
UPDATE clinics
SET is_active = true,
    subscription_status = 'trial'
WHERE email = 'limitlessbrainlab@gmail.com';
*/

-- FIX 3: Create auth user for clinic (optional - for Supabase auth)
