StorageService.js:\n   - Add avatarsBucket constant for ''avatars'' bucket\n   - Add uploadAvatar() method to upload profile images\n   - Add deleteAvatar() method to remove old avatars\n   - Validate image file type and size (max 5MB)\n   - Generate unique file paths: avatars/{role}/{userId}/avatar_{timestamp}.{ext}\n   - Return public URL from Supabase Storage\n\n2. ProfileModal.jsx:\n   - Import StorageService\n   - Add uploadingAvatar state for loading indicator\n   - Add selectedFile state to store file before upload\n   - Update handleAvatarUpload() to show preview first\n   - Update handleSave() to upload to Supabase before saving\n   - Show spinner on camera button during upload\n   - Clear selectedFile after successful save\n   - Use Supabase URL instead of base64\n\nHow it works now:\n1. User selects image → Preview shown immediately (base64)\n2. User clicks Save → Upload to Supabase Storage\n3. Get public URL from Supabase\n4. Save URL to database (logo_url field)\n5. On login → Fetch URL and display image\n\nBenefits:\n- Images stored in Supabase Storage (proper file storage)\n- Public URLs for fast access\n- No base64 bloat in database\n- Automatic CDN caching\n- Better performance and scalability\n- Images organized by role and user ID\n\nDatabase Storage:\n- clinics.logo_url = Supabase Storage URL (not base64)\n- Mapped to user.avatar for UI display\n\nIMPORTANT: Requires ''avatars'' bucket in Supabase Storage\nSetup Instructions:\n1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage\n2. Create new bucket named ''avatars''\n3. Set to Public bucket for public URLs\n4. Configure CORS if needed\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\""

Global CSS Rules (src/index.css):\n   - Target all LastPass DOM elements by:\n     * data-lastpass-icon-root\n     * data-lastpass-overlay\n     * id^=\"__lpform_\"\n     * id^=\"lp-pom-root\"\n     * z-index 2147483647 (LastPass specific)\n     * Background color rgb(230, 0, 23) (LastPass red)\n   - Force hide with multiple properties:\n     * display: none !important\n     * visibility: hidden !important\n     * opacity: 0 !important\n     * width: 0 !important\n     * height: 0 !important\n   - Also hide 1Password buttons\n   - Remove background images from inputs\n\n2. Meta Tags (index.html):\n   - <meta name=\"lastpass-disable\" content=\"true\" />\n   - <meta name=\"1password-disable\" content=\"true\" />\n   - Tells extensions to disable on this site\n\n3. CSS Selectors Used:\n   - Adjacent sibling (~)\n   - Direct sibling (+)\n   - Attribute starts with (^=)\n   - Attribute contains (*=)\n\nHow it works:\n- CSS hides icons immediately on page load\n- Meta tags prevent injection\n- data-lpignore tells extension to skip field\n- Multiple CSS rules ensure all variations are hidden\n\nIf icons still appear:\n1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)\n2. Disable LastPass extension\n3. Clear browser cache\n4. Check browser dev tools if elements exist\n\nThis is the most aggressive approach without disabling\nthe extension entirely in browser settings.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\""
