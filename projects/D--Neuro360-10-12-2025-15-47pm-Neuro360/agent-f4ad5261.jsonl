I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for the CLI.\n\nI can see you're working in the Neuro360 project (a React-based application with various pages and components). The repository is on the main branch with several modified files and backup files.\n\nHere's what I'm equipped to do:\n\n1. **Glob searches** - Find files matching patterns (e.g., all .jsx files, files in specific directories)\n2. **Grep searches** - Search file contents using regex patterns to find specific code, functions, or text\n3. **Read files** - View the contents of specific files you're interested in\n4. **Bash operations** - List directories, check file structure, and explore the codebase\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? For example, I can:\n- Find all React components in your project\n- Search for specific functions or imports\n- Locate configuration files\n- Find files containing particular text or patterns\n- Explore the project structure\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1018,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":242,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CW7vtKPo6vhgk3LEb37u1","type":"assistant","uuid":"9e676b62-b099-4f54-ae61-e238dbca1c75","timestamp":"2025-12-15T05:35:31.353Z"}
