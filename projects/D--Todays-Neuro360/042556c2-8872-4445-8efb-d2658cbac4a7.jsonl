Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt (highly improved for complete extraction)\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist. Your task is to extract COMPLETE frequency band data from this ${conditionName} QEEG report PDF.\n\n🎯 YOUR MISSION: Extract 100% COMPLETE DATA - No Missing Bands Allowed!\n\n📊 WHAT TO EXTRACT:\nExtract TWO complete tables:\n1. **Absolute Power (μV²)** - Brain wave power in microvolts squared\n2. **Relative Power (%)** - Percentage distribution (MUST sum to ~100% per channel)\n\n📍 WHERE TO LOOK IN THE PDF:\n- Usually on Pages 13 & 24 (for Eyes Open & Eyes Closed)\n- Look for table headers like:\n  * \"Absolute Power\" / \"Absolute Spectral Power\" / \"Absolute\" / \"ABS\"\n  * \"Relative Power\" / \"Relative Spectral Power\" / \"Relative\" / \"REL\"\n  * \"Monopolar\" / \"Linked Ears\" / \"Average Reference\"\n- Tables may span multiple pages - check thoroughly!\n- Sometimes bands are in separate sections or sub-tables\n\n🧠 CHANNELS TO EXTRACT (19 channels):\nFP1, FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2\n\n📊 FREQUENCY BANDS (ALL 5 REQUIRED):\nFor EACH channel, you MUST extract ALL 5 bands:\n1. **Delta** (δ) - 0.5-4 Hz - Usually highest power\n2. **Theta** (θ) - 4-8 Hz\n3. **Alpha** (α) - 8-13 Hz - Often dominant when relaxed\n4. **Beta** (β) - 13-30 Hz\n5. **HiBeta** (High Beta / ββ) - 30-50 Hz - Usually smallest\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n\n1. **100% COMPLETENESS**: Extract ALL 5 bands for EVERY channel\n   - If a band shows \"0\" or very small value (0.1, 0.01), INCLUDE IT\n   - DO NOT leave any band as 0 unless it truly says 0 in the table\n\n2. **VALIDATION CHECK**: For Relative Power, EACH channel must sum to ~100%\n   Example: Fz: Delta(30%) + Theta(20%) + Alpha(25%) + Beta(20%) + HiBeta(5%) = 100%\n   - If your extracted data doesn't sum to ~100% for EACH channel, YOU MADE A MISTAKE\n   - Go back and find the missing bands!\n\n3. **SEARCH THOROUGHLY**:\n   - Check ALL pages of the PDF, not just the first page\n   - Look for continuation of tables on next pages\n   - Some PDFs have separate sub-tables for each band - combine them\n   - Tables might be labeled \"Page 1/2\", \"Page 2/2\" - check both!\n\n4. **DON'T SKIP CHANNELS**: All 19 channels should have complete data\n   - If some channels are truly missing from PDF, use 0 for those\n   - But most standard QEEG reports have all 19 channels\n\n5. **PRESERVE EXACT VALUES**: Copy numbers exactly as they appear\n   - Don't round or modify values\n   - Include decimal places (e.g., 25.3, not 25)\n\n📋 EXAMPLE OF **CORRECT** EXTRACTION (Relative Power):\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Alpha\": 25.1,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Beta\": 18.9,    // ✓ Has value\n    \"HiBeta\": 5.2    // ✓ Has value\n  }\n  // Sum = 100% ✓ CORRECT!\n}\n\n❌ EXAMPLE OF **WRONG** EXTRACTION:\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,\n    \"Alpha\": 0,      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"Beta\": 0,       // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"HiBeta\": 0      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n  }\n  // Sum = 50.8% ❌ INCOMPLETE! Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

Your task is to extract COMPLETE frequency band data from this ${conditionName} QEEG report PDF.\n\n🎯 YOUR MISSION: Extract 100% COMPLETE DATA - No Missing Bands Allowed!\n\n📊 WHAT TO EXTRACT:\nExtract TWO complete tables:\n1. **Absolute Power (μV²)** - Brain wave power in microvolts squared\n2. **Relative Power (%)** - Percentage distribution (MUST sum to ~100% per channel)\n\n📍 WHERE TO LOOK IN THE PDF:\n- Usually on Pages 13 & 24 (for Eyes Open & Eyes Closed)\n- Look for table headers like:\n  * \"Absolute Power\" / \"Absolute Spectral Power\" / \"Absolute\" / \"ABS\"\n  * \"Relative Power\" / \"Relative Spectral Power\" / \"Relative\" / \"REL\"\n  * \"Monopolar\" / \"Linked Ears\" / \"Average Reference\"\n- Tables may span multiple pages - check thoroughly!\n- Sometimes bands are in separate sections or sub-tables\n\n🧠 CHANNELS TO EXTRACT (19 channels):\nFP1, FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2\n\n📊 FREQUENCY BANDS (ALL 5 REQUIRED):\nFor EACH channel, you MUST extract ALL 5 bands:\n1. **Delta** (δ) - 0.5-4 Hz - Usually highest power\n2. **Theta** (θ) - 4-8 Hz\n3. **Alpha** (α) - 8-13 Hz - Often dominant when relaxed\n4. **Beta** (β) - 13-30 Hz\n5. **HiBeta** (High Beta / ββ) - 30-50 Hz - Usually smallest\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n\n1. **100% COMPLETENESS**: Extract ALL 5 bands for EVERY channel\n   - If a band shows \"0\" or very small value (0.1, 0.01), INCLUDE IT\n   - DO NOT leave any band as 0 unless it truly says 0 in the table\n\n2. **VALIDATION CHECK**: For Relative Power, EACH channel must sum to ~100%\n   Example: Fz: Delta(30%) + Theta(20%) + Alpha(25%) + Beta(20%) + HiBeta(5%) = 100%\n   - If your extracted data doesn't sum to ~100% for EACH channel, YOU MADE A MISTAKE\n   - Go back and find the missing bands!\n\n3. **SEARCH THOROUGHLY**:\n   - Check ALL pages of the PDF, not just the first page\n   - Look for continuation of tables on next pages\n   - Some PDFs have separate sub-tables for each band - combine them\n   - Tables might be labeled \"Page 1/2\", \"Page 2/2\" - check both!\n\n4. **DON'T SKIP CHANNELS**: All 19 channels should have complete data\n   - If some channels are truly missing from PDF, use 0 for those\n   - But most standard QEEG reports have all 19 channels\n\n5. **PRESERVE EXACT VALUES**: Copy numbers exactly as they appear\n   - Don't round or modify values\n   - Include decimal places (e.g., 25.3, not 25)\n\n📋 EXAMPLE OF **CORRECT** EXTRACTION (Relative Power):\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Alpha\": 25.1,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Beta\": 18.9,    // ✓ Has value\n    \"HiBeta\": 5.2    // ✓ Has value\n  }\n  // Sum = 100% ✓ CORRECT!\n}\n\n❌ EXAMPLE OF **WRONG** EXTRACTION:\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,\n    \"Alpha\": 0,      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"Beta\": 0,       // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"HiBeta\": 0      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n  }\n  // Sum = 50.8% ❌ INCOMPLETE! Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4.

Your primary task is to create a stunning, comprehensive, and visually captivating brain performance INFOGRAPHIC for patients.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BEFORE YOU START:\nYOU MUST USE THE EXACT SCORES PROVIDED IN THE INPUT DATA. DO NOT generate or invent your own scores. The scores are calculated from real patient brain data and MUST be preserved EXACTLY as provided. Your job is ONLY to create interpretations and visualizations - NOT to calculate or modify scores.\n\n🎯 YOUR ROLE:\nGenerate a professional single-page A4 INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE brain health report based on QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) analysis results. This is an INFOGRAPHIC, not a text document - prioritize visual presentation, clarity, and engaging design. The infographic must be informative yet accessible to non-medical readers.\n\n📊 INPUT DATA:\nYou will receive 7 brain performance parameters with their ACTUAL CALCULATED SCORES, classifications, and sub-metrics:\n1. **Cognition** - Mental processing, focus ability, and alpha-theta balance\n2. **Stress** - Arousal levels, relaxation capacity, and regeneration ability\n3. **Focus & Attention** - Concentration ability, theta levels, and mental alertness\n4. **Burnout & Fatigue** - Energy levels, exhaustion markers, and delta wave patterns\n5. **Emotional Regulation** - Mood stability, frontal alpha asymmetry, and emotional control\n6. **Learning** - Cognitive flexibility, memory formation, and neural plasticity\n7. **Creativity** - Divergent thinking, relaxation state, and innovative capacity\n\n📋 SCORING SYSTEM:\n- Each parameter is scored from 0-3 points\n- Classification: Low (0-1), Medium (2), High (3)\n- Sub-metrics contribute individual points to the total score\n- **Special Note**: For Stress and Burnout parameters, LOWER scores are BETTER (0/3 = Healthy, 3/3 = High Problem)\n\n🎨 INFOGRAPHIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\n\n**REMEMBER: This is an INFOGRAPHIC - Visual Appeal is CRITICAL!**\n\n1. **Infographic Visual Design**:\n   - INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE: Modern, clean, colorful, and engaging layout\n   - Use vibrant but professional color palette throughout\n   - Each parameter MUST have a distinct visual identity with unique colors\n   - Bold, eye-catching icons and graphical elements for each brain function\n   - Large, prominent score displays with visual progress indicators\n   - Color-coded scoring badges/banners (Green = Optimal, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Needs Attention)\n   - Think: Magazine infographic quality, not medical report\n   - Visual hierarchy: Big scores → Clear icons → Short summaries → Details\n\n2. **Content Structure**:\n   - Patient-friendly language (avoid heavy medical jargon)\n   - One-line impactful summary for each parameter\n   - Clear explanation of what each metric means in daily life\n   - Practical interpretation of scores\n   - Holistic overall summary\n\n3. **Infographic Parameter Presentation**:\n   - Parameter name in BOLD, LARGE font with matching icon\n   - Score displayed PROMINENTLY (e.g., \"2/3 - Medium\") with colored background badge\n   - Eye-catching color-coded badge/banner based on classification\n   - Visual progress bar or circular indicator for scores\n   - List all sub-metrics with bold checkmarks (✓) or crosses (✗)\n   - Ultra-concise explanation for each sub-metric (1 sentence max)\n   - Use boxes, borders, and visual separators for clarity\n\n4. **Color Coding Guidelines**:\n   For HEALTH parameters (Cognition, Focus, Emotional Regulation, Learning, Creativity):\n   - High (3/3): #38A169 (Green) - Excellent performance\n   - Medium (2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Good, room for improvement\n   - Low (0-1/3): #E53E3E (Red) - Needs attention\n\n   For PROBLEM parameters (Stress, Burnout):\n   - Low (0/3): #38A169 (Green) - Healthy, no issues\n   - Medium (1-2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Moderate concern\n   - High (3/3): #E53E3E (Red) - High concern\n\n5. **Interpretations Guidelines**:\n   - Explain what HIGH scores mean for each parameter\n   - Explain what LOW scores mean\n   - Connect brain metrics to real-life implications\n   - Examples:\n     * \"High Focus & Attention (3/3): Your brain shows excellent concentration ability and minimal distracting theta activity\"\n     * \"Low Stress (0/3): Great news! Your brain shows healthy relaxation patterns and low arousal\"\n     * \"Medium Cognition (2/3): Good cognitive function with room for optimization in alpha-theta balance\"\n\n6. **Sub-Metrics Explanation Examples**:\n   - \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio): ✓ Optimal - Your frontal brain regions show balanced activity for sustained attention\"\n   - \"Relaxation Score: ✗ Below threshold - Your brain may have difficulty shifting into relaxed states\"\n   - \"Alpha Peak: ✓ Normal - Healthy alpha rhythm frequency indicates good brain maturation\"\n\n7. **Overall Summary Requirements**:\n   - Synthesize all 7 parameters into a cohesive narrative\n   - Highlight strengths and areas for improvement\n   - Provide context about what the overall pattern suggests\n   - Maintain encouraging and constructive tone\n   - 3-5 sentences maximum\n\n8. **Recommendations**:\n   - Provide 4-6 actionable, personalized recommendations\n   - Base suggestions on the actual scores received\n   - Include lifestyle, cognitive training, or mindfulness suggestions\n   - Keep recommendations practical and achievable\n\n📤 OUTPUT FORMAT FOR INFOGRAPHIC:\n\n⚠️ REMEMBER: Use the EXACT score, maxScore, and bucket values from the INPUT DATA. Do not modify them!\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations) with this EXACT structure optimized for INFOGRAPHIC design:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Brain Performance Infographic\",\n  \"subtitle\": \"Visual Analysis of Your Brain Health Metrics\",\n  \"patientSummary\": \"A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary synthesizing all parameters, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth, with an encouraging and engaging tone suitable for an infographic\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cognition\",\n      \"score\": 2,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SCORE FROM INPUT - this is just an example */\n      \"maxScore\": 3,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT maxScore FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucket\": \"Medium\",  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT bucket FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucketColor\": \"#F59E0B\",\n      \"icon\": \"🧠\",\n      \"summary\": \"One ultra-impactful, short sentence summarizing this parameter (infographic-style: punchy and clear)\",\n      \"subparameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio)\",\n          \"score\": 1,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SUBPARAMETER SCORE FROM INPUT */\n          \"interpretation\": \"Clear, concise explanation (max 15 words) of what this score means\",\n          \"details\": \"Technical detail: actual value and threshold\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Specific actionable recommendation (concise, infographic-friendly)\",\n    \"Another personalized suggestion (short and clear)\",\n    \"Lifestyle tip (engaging and practical)\",\n    \"Cognitive exercise or mindfulness practice (action-oriented)\"\n  ],\n  \"layoutSuggestions\": {\n    \"colorScheme\": \"Vibrant infographic palette: Deep blue header (#323956), colorful parameter badges, white background (#FFFFFF), accent colors for visual interest\",\n    \"structure\": \"Infographic grid layout: 2 columns for parameters with visual cards, bold header with title and patient info, eye-catching summary and recommendations section at bottom with icons\"\n  }\n}\n\n🚨 CRITICAL INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt (highly improved for complete extraction)\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist. Your task is to extract COMPLETE frequency band data from this ${conditionName} QEEG report PDF.\n\n🎯 YOUR MISSION: Extract 100% COMPLETE DATA - No Missing Bands Allowed!\n\n📊 WHAT TO EXTRACT:\nExtract TWO complete tables:\n1. **Absolute Power (μV²)** - Brain wave power in microvolts squared\n2. **Relative Power (%)** - Percentage distribution (MUST sum to ~100% per channel)\n\n📍 WHERE TO LOOK IN THE PDF:\n- Usually on Pages 13 & 24 (for Eyes Open & Eyes Closed)\n- Look for table headers like:\n  * \"Absolute Power\" / \"Absolute Spectral Power\" / \"Absolute\" / \"ABS\"\n  * \"Relative Power\" / \"Relative Spectral Power\" / \"Relative\" / \"REL\"\n  * \"Monopolar\" / \"Linked Ears\" / \"Average Reference\"\n- Tables may span multiple pages - check thoroughly!\n- Sometimes bands are in separate sections or sub-tables\n\n🧠 CHANNELS TO EXTRACT (19 channels):\nFP1, FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2\n\n📊 FREQUENCY BANDS (ALL 5 REQUIRED):\nFor EACH channel, you MUST extract ALL 5 bands:\n1. **Delta** (δ) - 0.5-4 Hz - Usually highest power\n2. **Theta** (θ) - 4-8 Hz\n3. **Alpha** (α) - 8-13 Hz - Often dominant when relaxed\n4. **Beta** (β) - 13-30 Hz\n5. **HiBeta** (High Beta / ββ) - 30-50 Hz - Usually smallest\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n\n1. **100% COMPLETENESS**: Extract ALL 5 bands for EVERY channel\n   - If a band shows \"0\" or very small value (0.1, 0.01), INCLUDE IT\n   - DO NOT leave any band as 0 unless it truly says 0 in the table\n\n2. **VALIDATION CHECK**: For Relative Power, EACH channel must sum to ~100%\n   Example: Fz: Delta(30%) + Theta(20%) + Alpha(25%) + Beta(20%) + HiBeta(5%) = 100%\n   - If your extracted data doesn't sum to ~100% for EACH channel, YOU MADE A MISTAKE\n   - Go back and find the missing bands!\n\n3. **SEARCH THOROUGHLY**:\n   - Check ALL pages of the PDF, not just the first page\n   - Look for continuation of tables on next pages\n   - Some PDFs have separate sub-tables for each band - combine them\n   - Tables might be labeled \"Page 1/2\", \"Page 2/2\" - check both!\n\n4. **DON'T SKIP CHANNELS**: All 19 channels should have complete data\n   - If some channels are truly missing from PDF, use 0 for those\n   - But most standard QEEG reports have all 19 channels\n\n5. **PRESERVE EXACT VALUES**: Copy numbers exactly as they appear\n   - Don't round or modify values\n   - Include decimal places (e.g., 25.3, not 25)\n\n📋 EXAMPLE OF **CORRECT** EXTRACTION (Relative Power):\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Alpha\": 25.1,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Beta\": 18.9,    // ✓ Has value\n    \"HiBeta\": 5.2    // ✓ Has value\n  }\n  // Sum = 100% ✓ CORRECT!\n}\n\n❌ EXAMPLE OF **WRONG** EXTRACTION:\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,\n    \"Alpha\": 0,      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"Beta\": 0,       // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"HiBeta\": 0      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n  }\n  // Sum = 50.8% ❌ INCOMPLETE! Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5.

Your primary task is to create a stunning, comprehensive, and visually captivating brain performance INFOGRAPHIC for patients.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BEFORE YOU START:\nYOU MUST USE THE EXACT SCORES PROVIDED IN THE INPUT DATA. DO NOT generate or invent your own scores. The scores are calculated from real patient brain data and MUST be preserved EXACTLY as provided. Your job is ONLY to create interpretations and visualizations - NOT to calculate or modify scores.\n\n🎯 YOUR ROLE:\nGenerate a professional single-page A4 INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE brain health report based on QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) analysis results. This is an INFOGRAPHIC, not a text document - prioritize visual presentation, clarity, and engaging design. The infographic must be informative yet accessible to non-medical readers.\n\n📊 INPUT DATA:\nYou will receive 7 brain performance parameters with their ACTUAL CALCULATED SCORES, classifications, and sub-metrics:\n1. **Cognition** - Mental processing, focus ability, and alpha-theta balance\n2. **Stress** - Arousal levels, relaxation capacity, and regeneration ability\n3. **Focus & Attention** - Concentration ability, theta levels, and mental alertness\n4. **Burnout & Fatigue** - Energy levels, exhaustion markers, and delta wave patterns\n5. **Emotional Regulation** - Mood stability, frontal alpha asymmetry, and emotional control\n6. **Learning** - Cognitive flexibility, memory formation, and neural plasticity\n7. **Creativity** - Divergent thinking, relaxation state, and innovative capacity\n\n📋 SCORING SYSTEM:\n- Each parameter is scored from 0-3 points\n- Classification: Low (0-1), Medium (2), High (3)\n- Sub-metrics contribute individual points to the total score\n- **Special Note**: For Stress and Burnout parameters, LOWER scores are BETTER (0/3 = Healthy, 3/3 = High Problem)\n\n🎨 INFOGRAPHIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\n\n**REMEMBER: This is an INFOGRAPHIC - Visual Appeal is CRITICAL!**\n\n1. **Infographic Visual Design**:\n   - INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE: Modern, clean, colorful, and engaging layout\n   - Use vibrant but professional color palette throughout\n   - Each parameter MUST have a distinct visual identity with unique colors\n   - Bold, eye-catching icons and graphical elements for each brain function\n   - Large, prominent score displays with visual progress indicators\n   - Color-coded scoring badges/banners (Green = Optimal, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Needs Attention)\n   - Think: Magazine infographic quality, not medical report\n   - Visual hierarchy: Big scores → Clear icons → Short summaries → Details\n\n2. **Content Structure**:\n   - Patient-friendly language (avoid heavy medical jargon)\n   - One-line impactful summary for each parameter\n   - Clear explanation of what each metric means in daily life\n   - Practical interpretation of scores\n   - Holistic overall summary\n\n3. **Infographic Parameter Presentation**:\n   - Parameter name in BOLD, LARGE font with matching icon\n   - Score displayed PROMINENTLY (e.g., \"2/3 - Medium\") with colored background badge\n   - Eye-catching color-coded badge/banner based on classification\n   - Visual progress bar or circular indicator for scores\n   - List all sub-metrics with bold checkmarks (✓) or crosses (✗)\n   - Ultra-concise explanation for each sub-metric (1 sentence max)\n   - Use boxes, borders, and visual separators for clarity\n\n4. **Color Coding Guidelines**:\n   For HEALTH parameters (Cognition, Focus, Emotional Regulation, Learning, Creativity):\n   - High (3/3): #38A169 (Green) - Excellent performance\n   - Medium (2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Good, room for improvement\n   - Low (0-1/3): #E53E3E (Red) - Needs attention\n\n   For PROBLEM parameters (Stress, Burnout):\n   - Low (0/3): #38A169 (Green) - Healthy, no issues\n   - Medium (1-2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Moderate concern\n   - High (3/3): #E53E3E (Red) - High concern\n\n5. **Interpretations Guidelines**:\n   - Explain what HIGH scores mean for each parameter\n   - Explain what LOW scores mean\n   - Connect brain metrics to real-life implications\n   - Examples:\n     * \"High Focus & Attention (3/3): Your brain shows excellent concentration ability and minimal distracting theta activity\"\n     * \"Low Stress (0/3): Great news! Your brain shows healthy relaxation patterns and low arousal\"\n     * \"Medium Cognition (2/3): Good cognitive function with room for optimization in alpha-theta balance\"\n\n6. **Sub-Metrics Explanation Examples**:\n   - \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio): ✓ Optimal - Your frontal brain regions show balanced activity for sustained attention\"\n   - \"Relaxation Score: ✗ Below threshold - Your brain may have difficulty shifting into relaxed states\"\n   - \"Alpha Peak: ✓ Normal - Healthy alpha rhythm frequency indicates good brain maturation\"\n\n7. **Overall Summary Requirements**:\n   - Synthesize all 7 parameters into a cohesive narrative\n   - Highlight strengths and areas for improvement\n   - Provide context about what the overall pattern suggests\n   - Maintain encouraging and constructive tone\n   - 3-5 sentences maximum\n\n8. **Recommendations**:\n   - Provide 4-6 actionable, personalized recommendations\n   - Base suggestions on the actual scores received\n   - Include lifestyle, cognitive training, or mindfulness suggestions\n   - Keep recommendations practical and achievable\n\n📤 OUTPUT FORMAT FOR INFOGRAPHIC:\n\n⚠️ REMEMBER: Use the EXACT score, maxScore, and bucket values from the INPUT DATA. Do not modify them!\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations) with this EXACT structure optimized for INFOGRAPHIC design:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Brain Performance Infographic\",\n  \"subtitle\": \"Visual Analysis of Your Brain Health Metrics\",\n  \"patientSummary\": \"A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary synthesizing all parameters, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth, with an encouraging and engaging tone suitable for an infographic\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cognition\",\n      \"score\": 2,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SCORE FROM INPUT - this is just an example */\n      \"maxScore\": 3,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT maxScore FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucket\": \"Medium\",  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT bucket FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucketColor\": \"#F59E0B\",\n      \"icon\": \"🧠\",\n      \"summary\": \"One ultra-impactful, short sentence summarizing this parameter (infographic-style: punchy and clear)\",\n      \"subparameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio)\",\n          \"score\": 1,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SUBPARAMETER SCORE FROM INPUT */\n          \"interpretation\": \"Clear, concise explanation (max 15 words) of what this score means\",\n          \"details\": \"Technical detail: actual value and threshold\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Specific actionable recommendation (concise, infographic-friendly)\",\n    \"Another personalized suggestion (short and clear)\",\n    \"Lifestyle tip (engaging and practical)\",\n    \"Cognitive exercise or mindfulness practice (action-oriented)\"\n  ],\n  \"layoutSuggestions\": {\n    \"colorScheme\": \"Vibrant infographic palette: Deep blue header (#323956), colorful parameter badges, white background (#FFFFFF), accent colors for visual interest\",\n    \"structure\": \"Infographic grid layout: 2 columns for parameters with visual cards, bold header with title and patient info, eye-catching summary and recommendations section at bottom with icons\"\n  }\n}\n\n🚨 CRITICAL INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS:\n1. THIS IS AN INFOGRAPHIC - Keep all text concise, punchy, and visual-friendly\n2. Return PURE JSON only - no code blocks, no markdown, no extra text\n3. Include ALL subparameters from input data - don't skip any\n4. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use the EXACT score values from the input data - DO NOT generate your own scores\n5. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Copy the score, maxScore, and bucket values EXACTLY as provided in the input\n6. Remember: For Stress and Burnout, LOW scores are GOOD, HIGH scores are CONCERNING\n7. Each subparameter must have the EXACT score (0 or 1) from the input data\n8. Icons should be colorful brain-related emojis: 🧠 💡 🎯 ⚡ 😌 📚 🎨 🌟 ⚖️ 🔥 or similar\n9. Make interpretations ultra-relatable - focus on real-world meaning, avoid EEG jargon\n10. Ensure bucketColor uses VIBRANT, DISTINCT hex codes for infographic appeal\n11. Overall tone: Engaging, visual, magazine-quality infographic style\n12. Summaries: Short, impactful, easy to scan (think social media infographic)\n13. ⚠️ DO NOT INVENT OR MODIFY SCORES - Use input data scores verbatim!\n\n✨ INFOGRAPHIC QUALITY CHECKLIST:\n- ⚠️ Did you copy the EXACT score values from the input data without modification?\n- ⚠️ Did you use the EXACT bucket/classification from the input data?\n- Are all 7 parameters included with distinct visual identities?\n- Do all parameters have their sub-metrics listed with visual indicators?\n- Are interpretations ultra-concise and infographic-friendly (no long paragraphs)?\n- Is the color coding vibrant and correct (especially for Stress/Burnout inverse scoring)?\n- Does the summary provide a holistic view in an engaging, scannable format?\n- Are recommendations specific, actionable, and infographic-ready?\n- Is the overall design ready for a beautiful, magazine-quality infographic?\n\n⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: Your ONLY job is to create interpretations and visual suggestions. The scores are ALREADY CALCULATED from real brain data. Copy them EXACTLY as provided!\n\nGenerate the INFOGRAPHIC report now based on the brain parameters data provided below.

Your primary task is to create a stunning, comprehensive, and visually captivating brain performance INFOGRAPHIC for patients.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BEFORE YOU START:\nYOU MUST USE THE EXACT SCORES PROVIDED IN THE INPUT DATA. DO NOT generate or invent your own scores. The scores are calculated from real patient brain data and MUST be preserved EXACTLY as provided. Your job is ONLY to create interpretations and visualizations - NOT to calculate or modify scores.\n\n🎯 YOUR ROLE:\nGenerate a professional single-page A4 INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE brain health report based on QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) analysis results. This is an INFOGRAPHIC, not a text document - prioritize visual presentation, clarity, and engaging design. The infographic must be informative yet accessible to non-medical readers.\n\n📊 INPUT DATA:\nYou will receive 7 brain performance parameters with their ACTUAL CALCULATED SCORES, classifications, and sub-metrics:\n1. **Cognition** - Mental processing, focus ability, and alpha-theta balance\n2. **Stress** - Arousal levels, relaxation capacity, and regeneration ability\n3. **Focus & Attention** - Concentration ability, theta levels, and mental alertness\n4. **Burnout & Fatigue** - Energy levels, exhaustion markers, and delta wave patterns\n5. **Emotional Regulation** - Mood stability, frontal alpha asymmetry, and emotional control\n6. **Learning** - Cognitive flexibility, memory formation, and neural plasticity\n7. **Creativity** - Divergent thinking, relaxation state, and innovative capacity\n\n📋 SCORING SYSTEM:\n- Each parameter is scored from 0-3 points\n- Classification: Low (0-1), Medium (2), High (3)\n- Sub-metrics contribute individual points to the total score\n- **Special Note**: For Stress and Burnout parameters, LOWER scores are BETTER (0/3 = Healthy, 3/3 = High Problem)\n\n🎨 INFOGRAPHIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\n\n**REMEMBER: This is an INFOGRAPHIC - Visual Appeal is CRITICAL!**\n\n1. **Infographic Visual Design**:\n   - INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE: Modern, clean, colorful, and engaging layout\n   - Use vibrant but professional color palette throughout\n   - Each parameter MUST have a distinct visual identity with unique colors\n   - Bold, eye-catching icons and graphical elements for each brain function\n   - Large, prominent score displays with visual progress indicators\n   - Color-coded scoring badges/banners (Green = Optimal, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Needs Attention)\n   - Think: Magazine infographic quality, not medical report\n   - Visual hierarchy: Big scores → Clear icons → Short summaries → Details\n\n2. **Content Structure**:\n   - Patient-friendly language (avoid heavy medical jargon)\n   - One-line impactful summary for each parameter\n   - Clear explanation of what each metric means in daily life\n   - Practical interpretation of scores\n   - Holistic overall summary\n\n3. **Infographic Parameter Presentation**:\n   - Parameter name in BOLD, LARGE font with matching icon\n   - Score displayed PROMINENTLY (e.g., \"2/3 - Medium\") with colored background badge\n   - Eye-catching color-coded badge/banner based on classification\n   - Visual progress bar or circular indicator for scores\n   - List all sub-metrics with bold checkmarks (✓) or crosses (✗)\n   - Ultra-concise explanation for each sub-metric (1 sentence max)\n   - Use boxes, borders, and visual separators for clarity\n\n4. **Color Coding Guidelines**:\n   For HEALTH parameters (Cognition, Focus, Emotional Regulation, Learning, Creativity):\n   - High (3/3): #38A169 (Green) - Excellent performance\n   - Medium (2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Good, room for improvement\n   - Low (0-1/3): #E53E3E (Red) - Needs attention\n\n   For PROBLEM parameters (Stress, Burnout):\n   - Low (0/3): #38A169 (Green) - Healthy, no issues\n   - Medium (1-2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Moderate concern\n   - High (3/3): #E53E3E (Red) - High concern\n\n5. **Interpretations Guidelines**:\n   - Explain what HIGH scores mean for each parameter\n   - Explain what LOW scores mean\n   - Connect brain metrics to real-life implications\n   - Examples:\n     * \"High Focus & Attention (3/3): Your brain shows excellent concentration ability and minimal distracting theta activity\"\n     * \"Low Stress (0/3): Great news! Your brain shows healthy relaxation patterns and low arousal\"\n     * \"Medium Cognition (2/3): Good cognitive function with room for optimization in alpha-theta balance\"\n\n6. **Sub-Metrics Explanation Examples**:\n   - \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio): ✓ Optimal - Your frontal brain regions show balanced activity for sustained attention\"\n   - \"Relaxation Score: ✗ Below threshold - Your brain may have difficulty shifting into relaxed states\"\n   - \"Alpha Peak: ✓ Normal - Healthy alpha rhythm frequency indicates good brain maturation\"\n\n7. **Overall Summary Requirements**:\n   - Synthesize all 7 parameters into a cohesive narrative\n   - Highlight strengths and areas for improvement\n   - Provide context about what the overall pattern suggests\n   - Maintain encouraging and constructive tone\n   - 3-5 sentences maximum\n\n8. **Recommendations**:\n   - Provide 4-6 actionable, personalized recommendations\n   - Base suggestions on the actual scores received\n   - Include lifestyle, cognitive training, or mindfulness suggestions\n   - Keep recommendations practical and achievable\n\n📤 OUTPUT FORMAT FOR INFOGRAPHIC:\n\n⚠️ REMEMBER: Use the EXACT score, maxScore, and bucket values from the INPUT DATA. Do not modify them!\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations) with this EXACT structure optimized for INFOGRAPHIC design:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Brain Performance Infographic\",\n  \"subtitle\": \"Visual Analysis of Your Brain Health Metrics\",\n  \"patientSummary\": \"A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary synthesizing all parameters, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth, with an encouraging and engaging tone suitable for an infographic\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cognition\",\n      \"score\": 2,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SCORE FROM INPUT - this is just an example */\n      \"maxScore\": 3,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT maxScore FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucket\": \"Medium\",  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT bucket FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucketColor\": \"#F59E0B\",\n      \"icon\": \"🧠\",\n      \"summary\": \"One ultra-impactful, short sentence summarizing this parameter (infographic-style: punchy and clear)\",\n      \"subparameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio)\",\n          \"score\": 1,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SUBPARAMETER SCORE FROM INPUT */\n          \"interpretation\": \"Clear, concise explanation (max 15 words) of what this score means\",\n          \"details\": \"Technical detail: actual value and threshold\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Specific actionable recommendation (concise, infographic-friendly)\",\n    \"Another personalized suggestion (short and clear)\",\n    \"Lifestyle tip (engaging and practical)\",\n    \"Cognitive exercise or mindfulness practice (action-oriented)\"\n  ],\n  \"layoutSuggestions\": {\n    \"colorScheme\": \"Vibrant infographic palette: Deep blue header (#323956), colorful parameter badges, white background (#FFFFFF), accent colors for visual interest\",\n    \"structure\": \"Infographic grid layout: 2 columns for parameters with visual cards, bold header with title and patient info, eye-catching summary and recommendations section at bottom with icons\"\n  }\n}\n\n🚨 CRITICAL INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS:\n1. THIS IS AN INFOGRAPHIC - Keep all text concise, punchy, and visual-friendly\n2. Return PURE JSON only - no code blocks, no markdown, no extra text\n3. Include ALL subparameters from input data - don't skip any\n4. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use the EXACT score values from the input data - DO NOT generate your own scores\n5. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Copy the score, maxScore, and bucket values EXACTLY as provided in the input\n6. Remember: For Stress and Burnout, LOW scores are GOOD, HIGH scores are CONCERNING\n7. Each subparameter must have the EXACT score (0 or 1) from the input data\n8. Icons should be colorful brain-related emojis: 🧠 💡 🎯 ⚡ 😌 📚 🎨 🌟 ⚖️ 🔥 or similar\n9. Make interpretations ultra-relatable - focus on real-world meaning, avoid EEG jargon\n10. Ensure bucketColor uses VIBRANT, DISTINCT hex codes for infographic appeal\n11. Overall tone: Engaging, visual, magazine-quality infographic style\n12. Summaries: Short, impactful, easy to scan (think social media infographic)\n13. ⚠️ DO NOT INVENT OR MODIFY SCORES - Use input data scores verbatim!\n\n✨ INFOGRAPHIC QUALITY CHECKLIST:\n- ⚠️ Did you copy the EXACT score values from the input data without modification?\n- ⚠️ Did you use the EXACT bucket/classification from the input data?\n- Are all 7 parameters included with distinct visual identities?\n- Do all parameters have their sub-metrics listed with visual indicators?\n- Are interpretations ultra-concise and infographic-friendly (no long paragraphs)?\n- Is the color coding vibrant and correct (especially for Stress/Burnout inverse scoring)?\n- Does the summary provide a holistic view in an engaging, scannable format?\n- Are recommendations specific, actionable, and infographic-ready?\n- Is the overall design ready for a beautiful, magazine-quality infographic?\n\n⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: Your ONLY job is to create interpretations and visual suggestions.

Your primary task is to create a stunning, comprehensive, and visually captivating brain performance INFOGRAPHIC for patients.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BEFORE YOU START:\nYOU MUST USE THE EXACT SCORES PROVIDED IN THE INPUT DATA. DO NOT generate or invent your own scores. The scores are calculated from real patient brain data and MUST be preserved EXACTLY as provided. Your job is ONLY to create interpretations and visualizations - NOT to calculate or modify scores.\n\n🎯 YOUR ROLE:\nGenerate a professional single-page A4 INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE brain health report based on QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) analysis results. This is an INFOGRAPHIC, not a text document - prioritize visual presentation, clarity, and engaging design. The infographic must be informative yet accessible to non-medical readers.\n\n📊 INPUT DATA:\nYou will receive 7 brain performance parameters with their ACTUAL CALCULATED SCORES, classifications, and sub-metrics:\n1. **Cognition** - Mental processing, focus ability, and alpha-theta balance\n2. **Stress** - Arousal levels, relaxation capacity, and regeneration ability\n3. **Focus & Attention** - Concentration ability, theta levels, and mental alertness\n4. **Burnout & Fatigue** - Energy levels, exhaustion markers, and delta wave patterns\n5. **Emotional Regulation** - Mood stability, frontal alpha asymmetry, and emotional control\n6. **Learning** - Cognitive flexibility, memory formation, and neural plasticity\n7. **Creativity** - Divergent thinking, relaxation state, and innovative capacity\n\n📋 SCORING SYSTEM:\n- Each parameter is scored from 0-3 points\n- Classification: Low (0-1), Medium (2), High (3)\n- Sub-metrics contribute individual points to the total score\n- **Special Note**: For Stress and Burnout parameters, LOWER scores are BETTER (0/3 = Healthy, 3/3 = High Problem)\n\n🎨 INFOGRAPHIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\n\n**REMEMBER: This is an INFOGRAPHIC - Visual Appeal is CRITICAL!**\n\n1. **Infographic Visual Design**:\n   - INFOGRAPHIC-STYLE: Modern, clean, colorful, and engaging layout\n   - Use vibrant but professional color palette throughout\n   - Each parameter MUST have a distinct visual identity with unique colors\n   - Bold, eye-catching icons and graphical elements for each brain function\n   - Large, prominent score displays with visual progress indicators\n   - Color-coded scoring badges/banners (Green = Optimal, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Needs Attention)\n   - Think: Magazine infographic quality, not medical report\n   - Visual hierarchy: Big scores → Clear icons → Short summaries → Details\n\n2. **Content Structure**:\n   - Patient-friendly language (avoid heavy medical jargon)\n   - One-line impactful summary for each parameter\n   - Clear explanation of what each metric means in daily life\n   - Practical interpretation of scores\n   - Holistic overall summary\n\n3. **Infographic Parameter Presentation**:\n   - Parameter name in BOLD, LARGE font with matching icon\n   - Score displayed PROMINENTLY (e.g., \"2/3 - Medium\") with colored background badge\n   - Eye-catching color-coded badge/banner based on classification\n   - Visual progress bar or circular indicator for scores\n   - List all sub-metrics with bold checkmarks (✓) or crosses (✗)\n   - Ultra-concise explanation for each sub-metric (1 sentence max)\n   - Use boxes, borders, and visual separators for clarity\n\n4. **Color Coding Guidelines**:\n   For HEALTH parameters (Cognition, Focus, Emotional Regulation, Learning, Creativity):\n   - High (3/3): #38A169 (Green) - Excellent performance\n   - Medium (2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Good, room for improvement\n   - Low (0-1/3): #E53E3E (Red) - Needs attention\n\n   For PROBLEM parameters (Stress, Burnout):\n   - Low (0/3): #38A169 (Green) - Healthy, no issues\n   - Medium (1-2/3): #F59E0B (Amber) - Moderate concern\n   - High (3/3): #E53E3E (Red) - High concern\n\n5. **Interpretations Guidelines**:\n   - Explain what HIGH scores mean for each parameter\n   - Explain what LOW scores mean\n   - Connect brain metrics to real-life implications\n   - Examples:\n     * \"High Focus & Attention (3/3): Your brain shows excellent concentration ability and minimal distracting theta activity\"\n     * \"Low Stress (0/3): Great news! Your brain shows healthy relaxation patterns and low arousal\"\n     * \"Medium Cognition (2/3): Good cognitive function with room for optimization in alpha-theta balance\"\n\n6. **Sub-Metrics Explanation Examples**:\n   - \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio): ✓ Optimal - Your frontal brain regions show balanced activity for sustained attention\"\n   - \"Relaxation Score: ✗ Below threshold - Your brain may have difficulty shifting into relaxed states\"\n   - \"Alpha Peak: ✓ Normal - Healthy alpha rhythm frequency indicates good brain maturation\"\n\n7. **Overall Summary Requirements**:\n   - Synthesize all 7 parameters into a cohesive narrative\n   - Highlight strengths and areas for improvement\n   - Provide context about what the overall pattern suggests\n   - Maintain encouraging and constructive tone\n   - 3-5 sentences maximum\n\n8. **Recommendations**:\n   - Provide 4-6 actionable, personalized recommendations\n   - Base suggestions on the actual scores received\n   - Include lifestyle, cognitive training, or mindfulness suggestions\n   - Keep recommendations practical and achievable\n\n📤 OUTPUT FORMAT FOR INFOGRAPHIC:\n\n⚠️ REMEMBER: Use the EXACT score, maxScore, and bucket values from the INPUT DATA. Do not modify them!\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations) with this EXACT structure optimized for INFOGRAPHIC design:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Brain Performance Infographic\",\n  \"subtitle\": \"Visual Analysis of Your Brain Health Metrics\",\n  \"patientSummary\": \"A comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary synthesizing all parameters, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth, with an encouraging and engaging tone suitable for an infographic\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cognition\",\n      \"score\": 2,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SCORE FROM INPUT - this is just an example */\n      \"maxScore\": 3,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT maxScore FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucket\": \"Medium\",  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT bucket FROM INPUT */\n      \"bucketColor\": \"#F59E0B\",\n      \"icon\": \"🧠\",\n      \"summary\": \"One ultra-impactful, short sentence summarizing this parameter (infographic-style: punchy and clear)\",\n      \"subparameters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Focus Score (Theta:Beta Ratio)\",\n          \"score\": 1,  /* ⚠️ USE EXACT SUBPARAMETER SCORE FROM INPUT */\n          \"interpretation\": \"Clear, concise explanation (max 15 words) of what this score means\",\n          \"details\": \"Technical detail: actual value and threshold\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Specific actionable recommendation (concise, infographic-friendly)\",\n    \"Another personalized suggestion (short and clear)\",\n    \"Lifestyle tip (engaging and practical)\",\n    \"Cognitive exercise or mindfulness practice (action-oriented)\"\n  ],\n  \"layoutSuggestions\": {\n    \"colorScheme\": \"Vibrant infographic palette: Deep blue header (#323956), colorful parameter badges, white background (#FFFFFF), accent colors for visual interest\",\n    \"structure\": \"Infographic grid layout: 2 columns for parameters with visual cards, bold header with title and patient info, eye-catching summary and recommendations section at bottom with icons\"\n  }\n}\n\n🚨 CRITICAL INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

Summaries: Short, impactful, easy to scan (think social media infographic)\n13. ⚠️ DO NOT INVENT OR MODIFY SCORES - Use input data scores verbatim!\n\n✨ INFOGRAPHIC QUALITY CHECKLIST:\n- ⚠️ Did you copy the EXACT score values from the input data without modification?\n- ⚠️ Did you use the EXACT bucket/classification from the input data?\n- Are all 7 parameters included with distinct visual identities?\n- Do all parameters have their sub-metrics listed with visual indicators?\n- Are interpretations ultra-concise and infographic-friendly (no long paragraphs)?\n- Is the color coding vibrant and correct (especially for Stress/Burnout inverse scoring)?\n- Does the summary provide a holistic view in an engaging, scannable format?\n- Are recommendations specific, actionable, and infographic-ready?\n- Is the overall design ready for a beautiful, magazine-quality infographic?\n\n⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: Your ONLY job is to create interpretations and visual suggestions.

You can process 4 more patients today.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Pricing Information\n\n### Free Tier (No Billing)\n- **Limit**: 20 requests/day, 2 requests/minute\n- **Cost**: $0\n- **Best for**: Testing, development, personal projects\n\n### Pay-as-you-go (Billing Enabled + Quota Increase)\n- **Default after increase**: 1000+ requests/day, 60+ requests/minute\n- **Cost**: ~$0.00025 per request (varies by model)\n- **Example**: 100 requests/day = ~$0.025/day = ~$0.75/month\n- **Best for**: Production applications\n\n### Vertex AI (Enterprise)\n- **Limit**: Thousands of requests/minute\n- **Cost**: Similar to Generative Language API\n- **Features**: Better quota management, SLA, enterprise support\n- **Best for**: Large-scale production deployments\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: \"Quota exceeded\" even after billing enabled\n\n**Cause:** Billing enabled but quotas not increased.\n\n**Solution:** Follow Step 3 above to request quota increase.\n\n---\n\n### Issue: \"Quota increase request denied\"\n\n**Cause:** Google requires usage history or business justification.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use free tier for a few days to establish usage pattern\n2. Provide detailed business case in quota request\n3. Contact Google Cloud support for assistance\n\n---\n\n### Issue: \"API key works in AI Studio but not in app\"\n\n**Cause:** API key might be from different project than billing-enabled one.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Verify API key is from the correct project\n2. Delete old API key\n3. Create new API key in the billing-enabled project\n4. Update `.env` file with new key\n\n---\n\n### Issue: \"Still getting quota errors with high limits\"\n\n**Cause:** App might be making too many concurrent requests.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Check app rate limiting is enabled\n2. Increase `GEMINI_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` in `.env`\n3. Monitor quota usage via `/api/qeeg/quota-status` endpoint\n\n## Summary\n\n1. ✅ **Enable Billing** on Google Cloud project\n2. ✅ **Upgrade to \"Pay as you go\"** in AI Studio\n3. ✅ **Request Quota Increase** in Google Cloud Console quotas page\n4. ✅ **Wait for approval** (24-48 hours)\n5. ✅ **Update .env** with new limits after approval\n6. ✅ **Monitor usage** via `/api/qeeg/quota-status` endpoint\n\n**Current Status with Rate Limiting:**\n- Your app now enforces 30-second delays between API calls\n- Automatically tracks daily usage\n- Prevents exceeding quotas\n- Works within free tier limits (10 patients/day max)\n- Ready to scale up when quota increase is approved\n\n**Need Help?**\n- Google Cloud Support: https://cloud.google.com/support\n- Gemini API Pricing: https://ai.google.dev/pricing\n- Vertex AI Docs: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

Here's What I Did:\n\nThe issue is that **even with billing enabled, Google Cloud projects still have default quota limits set to free tier values**. You need to manually request a quota increase.\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n**1. Added Smart Rate Limiting** (server/services/geminiRateLimiter.js:1)\n- Shared rate limiter across all Gemini API calls\n- Enforces 30-second delay between requests\n- Tracks daily usage (20 requests/day limit)\n- Prevents hitting rate limits (2 requests/minute)\n\n**2. Integrated Rate Limiting** into:\n- server/services/qeegParser.js:7 - PDF extraction\n- server/services/geminiService.js:2 - Report generation\n\n**3. Added Quota Monitoring Endpoint** (server/routes/qeegRoutes.js:953)\n```bash\nGET http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n```\n\n**4. Created Comprehensive Guide** (GEMINI_QUOTA_INCREASE_GUIDE.md:1)\n- Step-by-step instructions to request quota increase\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n- Configuration options\n\n### How It Works Now:\n\n**With Current Free Tier Limits (20 requests/day):**\n- ✅ Automatic 30s delay between API calls\n- ✅ Can process **10 patients/day** (2 requests per patient: EO + EC)\n- ✅ No more quota errors if you stay within limits\n- ✅ Cached files don't consume quota\n\n**After Quota Increase (1000+ requests/day):**\n- ✅ Can process **500+ patients/day**\n- ✅ Just update .env with new limits\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n**Immediate (Use within current limits):**\n```bash\n# Your app now works! Just process max 10 patients/day\n# Each patient takes ~1 minute (30s delay x 2 files)\n```\n\n**To Scale Up:**\n1. **Request Quota Increase:**\n   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/quotas\n   - Select your project\n   - Request increase to 1000 requests/day\n   - Wait 24-48 hours for approval\n\n2. **Update .env after approval:**\n```env\nGEMINI_DAILY_LIMIT=1000\nGEMINI_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60\nGEMINI_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=1000  # Can reduce to 1 second\n```\n\n3. **Monitor usage:**\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n```\n\n### Why You're Getting Quota Errors:\n\n**NOT** because billing is disabled - it's because:\n1. ✅ Billing is enabled (correct)\n2. ❌ But quotas are still set to free tier defaults (20/day)\n3. ❌ Need to manually request quota increase in Google Cloud Console\n\n**The API key is fine - it just has low quotas.**\n\nSee `GEMINI_QUOTA_INCREASE_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":322,"cache_read_input_tokens":74222,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":322,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":803,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVvdrmysqbhNPF8fPuzJP","type":"assistant","uuid":"5d6c1f94-7896-4736-94c1-0b49dbb3d260","timestamp":"2025-12-09T06:25:59.023Z"}

You can process 9 more patients today.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Points (Dhyan Rakhna)\n\n### ✅ Kya Karna Hai:\n\n1. **Ek ek patient process karo** (1-2 minute wait karo beech mein)\n2. **Maximum 10 patients per day** process karo\n3. **Same files dobara upload karte ho** to cache use hoga (quota nahi katega)\n4. **Quota status check karte raho** quota-status endpoint se\n\n### ❌ Kya NAHI Karna:\n\n1. **Multiple patients ek saath submit mat karo** (quota jaldi khatam ho jayega)\n2. **Server restart mat karo beech mein** (quota counter reset ho jayega, galat count ho sakta hai)\n3. **20 requests cross mat karo** (error aayega)\n\n---\n\n## Daily Limit Track Karo\n\n### Morning Mein (Din Shuru Hote Hi):\n\n**Quota reset check karo:**\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n```\n\n**Dikhna chahiye:**\n```json\n{\n  \"daily\": {\n    \"used\": 0,\n    \"remaining\": 20\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Din Bhar:\n\n**Har patient ke baad:**\n- 1st patient: used = 2, remaining = 18\n- 2nd patient: used = 4, remaining = 16\n- 3rd patient: used = 6, remaining = 14\n- ...\n- 10th patient: used = 20, remaining = 0\n\n### Agar Quota Khatam Ho Jaye:\n\n**Error aayega:**\n```\n⚠️ Gemini API Daily Quota Exceeded!\nYou've used all 20 requests for today.\n\nSolutions:\n1. Wait until tomorrow (quota resets in 24 hours)\n2. Re-upload the SAME files (uses cache, no quota)\n3. Upgrade to paid plan\n```\n\n---\n\n## Smart Tips (Quota Bachane Ke Liye)\n\n### 1. Same Patient Dobara Process Karna Ho:\n\n**Wahi files dobara upload karo:**\n- Cache automatically use hoga\n- **Quota NAHI katega**\n- Instant result milega\n\n**Console mein dikhega:**\n```\n✅ CACHE HIT! Using cached extraction result\n📊 Cache Stats: 1 hits, 0 misses, 100% hit rate\n```\n\n### 2. Testing Ke Liye:\n\n**Same test files use karo baar baar:**\n- Pehli baar quota katega\n- Baaki baar cache se aayega (free)\n\n### 3. Priority Patients:\n\n**Important patients pehle process karo:**\n- Morning mein quota fresh hota hai\n- Evening tak quota khatam ho sakta hai\n\n---\n\n## Example: 1 Patient Process Karne Ka Full Flow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Server start karo (agar nahi chalu hai)\ncd server\nnpm start\n\n# 2. Frontend kholo browser mein\n# http://localhost:5173\n\n# 3. Files select karo\n- Eyes Open: patient1_EO.pdf\n- Eyes Closed: patient1_EC.pdf\n\n# 4. Patient details bharo\n- Name: Rahul Sharma\n- Age: 35\n\n# 5. Submit karo\n# Wait karo... (~1-2 minutes)\n\n# 6. Result dekho\n# Report generate hogi\n\n# 7. Quota check karo\n# http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n\n# Dikhega:\n{\n  \"used\": 2,      // 1 patient done\n  \"remaining\": 18 // 9 more patients possible\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Agar Problem Aaye\n\n### Problem 1: \"Rate limiting: Waiting 30s...\"\n\n**Matlab:** Rate limiter kaam kar raha hai (good!)\n\n**Solution:** Wait karo, automatic process ho jayega\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: \"Quota exceeded\"\n\n**Matlab:** 20 requests ho gaye aaj ke\n\n**Solution:** \n```bash\n# Check karo kitne requests use hue:\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n\n# Kal tak wait karo (quota reset hoga)\n# Ya same files dobara upload karo (cache use hoga)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3: Processing Bahut Slow Hai\n\n**Matlab:** 30 second delay lag rahi hai (normal hai)\n\n**Solution:** Ye zaruri hai quota bachane ke liye. Quota increase hone ke baad fast ho jayega.\n\n---\n\n## Daily Routine\n\n### Morning (9 AM):\n```bash\n# Server start karo\nnpm start\n\n# Quota check karo\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status\n# Fresh quota: 20 requests available\n```\n\n### Throughout Day:\n```\nPatient 1: 9:00 AM - 9:02 AM ✅ (remaining: 18)\nPatient 2: 9:05 AM - 9:07 AM ✅ (remaining: 16)\nPatient 3: 9:10 AM - 9:12 AM ✅ (remaining: 14)\n...\nPatient 10: 10:30 AM - 10:32 AM ✅ (remaining: 0)\n```\n\n### Evening:\n```\nQuota finished for today!\nWait till tomorrow 12 AM for reset.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Abhi kaam kaise chalega:**\n\n1. ✅ **10 patients/day** process kar sakte ho\n2. ✅ **Har patient**: ~1-2 minutes lagega\n3. ✅ **Total time**: ~10-20 minutes for all 10 patients\n4. ✅ **Same files dobara**: Cache use hoga (free)\n5. ⏰ **Kal subah**: Quota reset ho jayega (fresh 20 requests)\n\n**Quota increase ke baad:**\n- 500+ patients/day process kar paoge\n- Fast processing (1 second delay)\n- No tension about limits\n\n**Koi doubt hai?** Poochhlo! 😊"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1622,"cache_read_input_tokens":73786,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1622,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2239,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVveB3zYGxo3jLJaUbgTR","type":"assistant","uuid":"ff73c3a2-efee-4039-aeed-ef45328c3627","timestamp":"2025-12-09T06:30:33.362Z"}

Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist.

Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist.

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2.

Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt (highly improved for complete extraction)\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist. Your task is to extract COMPLETE frequency band data from this ${conditionName} QEEG report PDF.\n\n🎯 YOUR MISSION: Extract 100% COMPLETE DATA - No Missing Bands Allowed!\n\n📊 WHAT TO EXTRACT:\nExtract TWO complete tables:\n1. **Absolute Power (μV²)** - Brain wave power in microvolts squared\n2. **Relative Power (%)** - Percentage distribution (MUST sum to ~100% per channel)\n\n📍 WHERE TO LOOK IN THE PDF:\n- Usually on Pages 13 & 24 (for Eyes Open & Eyes Closed)\n- Look for table headers like:\n  * \"Absolute Power\" / \"Absolute Spectral Power\" / \"Absolute\" / \"ABS\"\n  * \"Relative Power\" / \"Relative Spectral Power\" / \"Relative\" / \"REL\"\n  * \"Monopolar\" / \"Linked Ears\" / \"Average Reference\"\n- Tables may span multiple pages - check thoroughly!\n- Sometimes bands are in separate sections or sub-tables\n\n🧠 CHANNELS TO EXTRACT (19 channels):\nFP1, FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2\n\n📊 FREQUENCY BANDS (ALL 5 REQUIRED):\nFor EACH channel, you MUST extract ALL 5 bands:\n1. **Delta** (δ) - 0.5-4 Hz - Usually highest power\n2. **Theta** (θ) - 4-8 Hz\n3. **Alpha** (α) - 8-13 Hz - Often dominant when relaxed\n4. **Beta** (β) - 13-30 Hz\n5. **HiBeta** (High Beta / ββ) - 30-50 Hz - Usually smallest\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n\n1. **100% COMPLETENESS**: Extract ALL 5 bands for EVERY channel\n   - If a band shows \"0\" or very small value (0.1, 0.01), INCLUDE IT\n   - DO NOT leave any band as 0 unless it truly says 0 in the table\n\n2. **VALIDATION CHECK**: For Relative Power, EACH channel must sum to ~100%\n   Example: Fz: Delta(30%) + Theta(20%) + Alpha(25%) + Beta(20%) + HiBeta(5%) = 100%\n   - If your extracted data doesn't sum to ~100% for EACH channel, YOU MADE A MISTAKE\n   - Go back and find the missing bands!\n\n3. **SEARCH THOROUGHLY**:\n   - Check ALL pages of the PDF, not just the first page\n   - Look for continuation of tables on next pages\n   - Some PDFs have separate sub-tables for each band - combine them\n   - Tables might be labeled \"Page 1/2\", \"Page 2/2\" - check both!\n\n4. **DON'T SKIP CHANNELS**: All 19 channels should have complete data\n   - If some channels are truly missing from PDF, use 0 for those\n   - But most standard QEEG reports have all 19 channels\n\n5. **PRESERVE EXACT VALUES**: Copy numbers exactly as they appear\n   - Don't round or modify values\n   - Include decimal places (e.g., 25.3, not 25)\n\n📋 EXAMPLE OF **CORRECT** EXTRACTION (Relative Power):\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Alpha\": 25.1,   // ✓ Has value\n    \"Beta\": 18.9,    // ✓ Has value\n    \"HiBeta\": 5.2    // ✓ Has value\n  }\n  // Sum = 100% ✓ CORRECT!\n}\n\n❌ EXAMPLE OF **WRONG** EXTRACTION:\n{\n  \"Fz\": {\n    \"Delta\": 28.5,\n    \"Theta\": 22.3,\n    \"Alpha\": 0,      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"Beta\": 0,       // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n    \"HiBeta\": 0      // ❌ WRONG - Missing!\n  }\n  // Sum = 50.8% ❌ INCOMPLETE! Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

OpenAI Ab Active Hai\n\nMaine aapke system ko configure kar diya hai ki **OpenAI GPT-4** use kare Gemini ke bajaye.\n\n### Kya Changes Kiye Gaye:\n\n1. ✅ **OpenAI Parser banaya** - `server/services/openAIParser.js`\n2. ✅ **QEEG Parser update kiya** - Ab OpenAI aur Gemini dono support karta hai\n3. ✅ **Environment variable set kiya** - `AI_SERVICE=openai` in `.env`\n4. ✅ **OpenAI API key already hai** - Aapki `.env` file mein\n\n---\n\n## Kaise Use Karein (Simple Steps)\n\n### Step 1: Server Restart Karo\n\n```bash\n# Terminal mein ye commands run karo:\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\\server\n\n# Agar server chal raha hai to Ctrl+C se band karo\n# Phir dobara start karo:\nnpm start\n```\n\n**Dikhna chahiye:**\n```\n🔀 AI Service: openai (using OpenAI GPT-4)\n✅ OpenAI API key found\n✅ Server running on port 5000\n```\n\n### Step 2: Patient Process Karo (Normal Tarike Se)\n\n```bash\n# Frontend bhi start karo (dusre terminal mein):\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Browser mein:**\n```\nhttp://localhost:5173\n```\n\n- Files upload karo (Eyes Open + Eyes Closed)\n- Patient details bharo\n- Submit karo\n\n**Ab ye OpenAI use karega Gemini ke bajaye!**\n\n---\n\n## Fayda Kya Hai? (Benefits)\n\n### ✅ OpenAI Ke Saath:\n\n1. **Zyada Quota:**\n   - OpenAI: ~10,000 requests/month (pay-as-you-go)\n   - Gemini free tier: 20 requests/day\n\n2. **Fast Processing:**\n   - No 30-second delay between requests\n   - Instant results (cache ka faida bhi)\n\n3. **Better Accuracy:**\n   - GPT-4 is very accurate for data extraction\n   - JSON format guarantee\n\n4. **No Rate Limiting Issues:**\n   - Aapki OpenAI key se billing enabled hai\n   - Quota easily handle hoga\n\n---\n\n## Cost Kitna Lagega? (OpenAI Pricing)\n\n**GPT-4 Turbo Pricing:**\n- Input: $10 per 1M tokens\n- Output: $30 per 1M tokens\n\n**Practical Example:**\n- 1 patient = 2 PDFs = ~30,000 tokens\n- Cost per patient: ~$0.05 (₹4 approx)\n- 100 patients: ~$5 (₹400 approx)\n- **Bahut reasonable!**\n\n**Check your usage:**\n```\nhttps://platform.openai.com/usage\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Current Setting (`.env` file):\n\n```env\n# AI Service Selection\nAI_SERVICE=openai          # OpenAI use kar raha hai\n\n# OpenAI Configuration\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... # Aapki API key (already set)\n\n# Gemini Configuration (backup)\nGEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...     # Agar wapas Gemini use karna ho\n```\n\n### Wapas Gemini Use Karna Ho:\n\n**Agar Gemini quota increase ho gaya** aur wapas Gemini use karna chahte ho:\n\n1. `.env` file mein change karo:\n   ```env\n   AI_SERVICE=gemini\n   ```\n\n2. Server restart karo:\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n3. Done! Ab Gemini use hoga.\n\n---\n\n## Testing (Verify It's Working)\n\n### Test 1: Server Logs Check Karo\n\n**Server start karte hi dikhna chahiye:**\n```\n🔀 Using OpenAI GPT-4 for PDF parsing (configured via AI_SERVICE)\n✅ OpenAI API key validation passed\n```\n\n### Test 2: Ek Patient Process Karo\n\n**Console mein dikhega:**\n```\n🔀 Using OpenAI GPT-4 for PDF parsing\n🤖 Calling OpenAI GPT-4...\n📝 OpenAI response received, length: 1234 characters\n✅ PDF data extracted and normalized successfully (EO)\n```\n\n### Test 3: Quota Check Karo\n\n**OpenAI usage check:**\n```\nhttps://platform.openai.com/usage\n```\n\n**Dekho kitne tokens use hue:**\n- Requests count increase honi chahiye\n- Cost track kar sakte ho\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Problem 1: \"OpenAI API key not found\"\n\n**Solution:**\n```bash\n# .env file check karo:\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\\server\ncat .env\n\n# OPENAI_API_KEY line dikhni chahiye\n# Agar nahi hai to add karo:\necho \"OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here\" >> .env\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: \"Rate limit exceeded\" (OpenAI)\n\n**Solution:**\n```bash\n# Check usage:\n# https://platform.openai.com/usage\n\n# Agar limit exceed ho gayi:\n# 1. Billing check karo\n# 2. Payment method add karo\n# 3. Usage limits increase karo\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3: \"Still using Gemini\"\n\n**Solution:**\n```bash\n# .env file verify karo:\ncat server/.env | grep AI_SERVICE\n\n# Dikhna chahiye:\n# AI_SERVICE=openai\n\n# Agar nahi hai to add karo:\necho \"AI_SERVICE=openai\" >> server/.env\n\n# Server restart karo:\nnpm start\n```\n\n---\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\n### Gemini (Free Tier):\n- ❌ 20 requests/day limit\n- ❌ 30-second delay between requests\n- ❌ Quota khatam hone ka tension\n- ✅ Free (no cost)\n\n### OpenAI (Pay-as-you-go):\n- ✅ 10,000+ requests/month\n- ✅ No artificial delays\n- ✅ Reliable and fast\n- ✅ Better accuracy\n- 💰 ~₹4 per patient (very reasonable)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Kya kiya:**\n1. ✅ OpenAI parser add kiya\n2. ✅ `.env` mein `AI_SERVICE=openai` set kiya\n3. ✅ Aapki existing OpenAI key use kar raha hai\n\n**Kya karna hai:**\n1. Server restart karo\n2. Normal tarike se patients process karo\n3.

OpenAI Ab Active Hai\n\nMaine aapke system ko configure kar diya hai ki **OpenAI GPT-4** use kare Gemini ke bajaye.\n\n### Kya Changes Kiye Gaye:\n\n1. ✅ **OpenAI Parser banaya** - `server/services/openAIParser.js`\n2. ✅ **QEEG Parser update kiya** - Ab OpenAI aur Gemini dono support karta hai\n3. ✅ **Environment variable set kiya** - `AI_SERVICE=openai` in `.env`\n4. ✅ **OpenAI API key already hai** - Aapki `.env` file mein\n\n---\n\n## Kaise Use Karein (Simple Steps)\n\n### Step 1: Server Restart Karo\n\n```bash\n# Terminal mein ye commands run karo:\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\\server\n\n# Agar server chal raha hai to Ctrl+C se band karo\n# Phir dobara start karo:\nnpm start\n```\n\n**Dikhna chahiye:**\n```\n🔀 AI Service: openai (using OpenAI GPT-4)\n✅ OpenAI API key found\n✅ Server running on port 5000\n```\n\n### Step 2: Patient Process Karo (Normal Tarike Se)\n\n```bash\n# Frontend bhi start karo (dusre terminal mein):\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Browser mein:**\n```\nhttp://localhost:5173\n```\n\n- Files upload karo (Eyes Open + Eyes Closed)\n- Patient details bharo\n- Submit karo\n\n**Ab ye OpenAI use karega Gemini ke bajaye!**\n\n---\n\n## Fayda Kya Hai? (Benefits)\n\n### ✅ OpenAI Ke Saath:\n\n1. **Zyada Quota:**\n   - OpenAI: ~10,000 requests/month (pay-as-you-go)\n   - Gemini free tier: 20 requests/day\n\n2. **Fast Processing:**\n   - No 30-second delay between requests\n   - Instant results (cache ka faida bhi)\n\n3. **Better Accuracy:**\n   - GPT-4 is very accurate for data extraction\n   - JSON format guarantee\n\n4. **No Rate Limiting Issues:**\n   - Aapki OpenAI key se billing enabled hai\n   - Quota easily handle hoga\n\n---\n\n## Cost Kitna Lagega? (OpenAI Pricing)\n\n**GPT-4 Turbo Pricing:**\n- Input: $10 per 1M tokens\n- Output: $30 per 1M tokens\n\n**Practical Example:**\n- 1 patient = 2 PDFs = ~30,000 tokens\n- Cost per patient: ~$0.05 (₹4 approx)\n- 100 patients: ~$5 (₹400 approx)\n- **Bahut reasonable!**\n\n**Check your usage:**\n```\nhttps://platform.openai.com/usage\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Current Setting (`.env` file):\n\n```env\n# AI Service Selection\nAI_SERVICE=openai          # OpenAI use kar raha hai\n\n# OpenAI Configuration\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... # Aapki API key (already set)\n\n# Gemini Configuration (backup)\nGEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...     # Agar wapas Gemini use karna ho\n```\n\n### Wapas Gemini Use Karna Ho:\n\n**Agar Gemini quota increase ho gaya** aur wapas Gemini use karna chahte ho:\n\n1. `.env` file mein change karo:\n   ```env\n   AI_SERVICE=gemini\n   ```\n\n2. Server restart karo:\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n3. Done! Ab Gemini use hoga.\n\n---\n\n## Testing (Verify It's Working)\n\n### Test 1: Server Logs Check Karo\n\n**Server start karte hi dikhna chahiye:**\n```\n🔀 Using OpenAI GPT-4 for PDF parsing (configured via AI_SERVICE)\n✅ OpenAI API key validation passed\n```\n\n### Test 2: Ek Patient Process Karo\n\n**Console mein dikhega:**\n```\n🔀 Using OpenAI GPT-4 for PDF parsing\n🤖 Calling OpenAI GPT-4...\n📝 OpenAI response received, length: 1234 characters\n✅ PDF data extracted and normalized successfully (EO)\n```\n\n### Test 3: Quota Check Karo\n\n**OpenAI usage check:**\n```\nhttps://platform.openai.com/usage\n```\n\n**Dekho kitne tokens use hue:**\n- Requests count increase honi chahiye\n- Cost track kar sakte ho\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Problem 1: \"OpenAI API key not found\"\n\n**Solution:**\n```bash\n# .env file check karo:\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\\server\ncat .env\n\n# OPENAI_API_KEY line dikhni chahiye\n# Agar nahi hai to add karo:\necho \"OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here\" >> .env\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: \"Rate limit exceeded\" (OpenAI)\n\n**Solution:**\n```bash\n# Check usage:\n# https://platform.openai.com/usage\n\n# Agar limit exceed ho gayi:\n# 1.

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2.

Find the missing bands!\n}\n\n🔍 EXTRACTION STRATEGY:\n1. First, locate the Absolute Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n2. Then, locate the Relative Power table - extract all bands for all channels\n3. Double-check: Does each channel's relative power sum to ~100%?\n4. If NO, go back and search for missing data in other pages/sections\n5. Extract Alpha Peak Frequency (usually noted as \"Peak Alpha\" or \"APF\")\n\nAlso extract Alpha Peak Frequency (APF) if available (typical range: 8-13 Hz).\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks)\n- Just pure JSON starting with { and ending with }\n- No \\`\\`\\`json markers\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nReturn the data in this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"absolute\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"relative\": {\n    \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n    \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"O1\": 10.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate MD5 hash of PDF file for caching\n   * @param {Buffer} dataBuffer - PDF file buffer\n   * @returns {string} MD5 hash\n   */\n  static calculatePDFHash(dataBuffer) {\n    return crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataBuffer).digest('hex');\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize extracted value to consistent decimal places\n   * Prevents precision-related variations\n   * @param {number} value - The value to normalize\n   * @param {number} decimalPlaces - Number of decimal places (default: 2)\n   * @returns {number|null} Normalized value\n   */\n  static normalizeValue(value, decimalPlaces = 2) {\n    if (value === null || value === undefined || isNaN(value)) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    // Round to consistent decimal places\n    const multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Normalize all values in extracted QEEG data\n   * Ensures consistent precision across all measurements\n   * @param {Object} extractedData - The raw extracted data\n   * @returns {Object} Normalized data\n   */\n  static normalizeExtractedData(extractedData) {\n    const normalized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(extractedData));

Do NOT include:\n- No markdown formatting (no \\`\\`\\`json or \\`\\`\\`)\n- No explanations before or after\n- No comments\n- Just pure JSON that starts with { and ends with }\n\nReturn ONLY this EXACT JSON format:\n{\n  \"zscores\": {\n    \"absolute\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    },\n    \"relative\": {\n      \"Fz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Cz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"Pz\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"F4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"C4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P3\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 },\n      \"P4\": { \"Delta\": 0.0, \"Theta\": 0.0, \"Alpha\": 0.0, \"Beta\": 0.0, \"HiBeta\": 0.0 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"special\": {\n    \"alphaPeak\": 10.0,\n    \"alphaPeakZscore\": 0.0\n  }\n}\n\nPDF Content:\n${pdfText.substring(0, 15000)}`;\n\n    } else {\n      // RAW POWER extraction prompt\n      return `You are an expert QEEG data extraction specialist.

Verify the console output shows \"OpenAI Parser loaded\"\n\nLet me give them clear step-by-step instructions in Hindi since they prefer that.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":90975,"cache_read_input_tokens":16358,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":90975,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVvfjyD6BYAqM7MCCpRFi","type":"assistant","uuid":"e77f5bf6-83b1-46d7-a329-58f8cfa4affe","timestamp":"2025-12-09T06:50:30.099Z"}

Purana server process abhi bhi chal raha hai.\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Solution (Step-by-Step Hindi Mein)\n\n### Step 1: Server Ko **Force Kill** Karo\n\n**Backend server ko completely band karna ZAROORI hai:**\n\n#### Option A: Task Manager Use Karo (Sabse Aasan)\n```\n1. Ctrl + Shift + Esc dabao (Task Manager khulega)\n2. \"Processes\" tab mein jao\n3. \"Node.js\" ya \"node.exe\" dhundo\n4. Right click karo → \"End Task\"\n5. SAARE Node processes ko kill karo (ek bhi chhodna nahi)\n```\n\n#### Option B: Command Prompt Se Port Free Karo\n```cmd\n# Command Prompt admin mode mein kholo\n# Port 5000 ko check karo:\nnetstat -ano | findstr :5000\n\n# Jo PID number dikhe (last column), use note karo\n# Example: 12345\n\n# Us process ko kill karo:\ntaskkill /PID 12345 /F\n\n# Confirm karo port free hai:\nnetstat -ano | findstr :5000\n# Kuch nahi dikhna chahiye\n```\n\n#### Option C: PowerShell Se (Automatic)\n```powershell\n# PowerShell admin mode mein ye run karo:\nGet-Process node | Stop-Process -Force\n```\n\n### Step 2: Confirm Karo Server Band Hai\n\n```bash\n# Git Bash ya terminal mein ye run karo:\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/test\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5000: Connection refused\n```\n\n**Matlab server successfully band ho gaya!** ✅\n\n### Step 3: Fresh Server Start Karo\n\n```bash\ncd D:\\Todays\\Neuro360\\server\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Step 4: **IMPORTANT - Console Output Dekho**\n\n**Server start hote hi, console mein ye ZARUR dikhna chahiye:**\n\n```\n🔧 Loading OpenAI Parser...\n   OpenAI API Key: Present (length: 164)\n✅ OpenAI Parser loaded successfully\n\n🔀 ===== AI SERVICE CONFIGURATION =====\n   AI_SERVICE env var: openai\n   FORCED AI service: openai (hardcoded)    ← YE LINE ZAROORI HAI\n   OpenAI key present: true\n   OpenAI key length: 164\n   Gemini key present: true\n=====================================\n\n✅ Server running on port 5000\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify Karo (Browser Console Mein)\n\n**Backend terminal ka screenshot leke bhejo:**\n- Mujhe ye confirm karna hai ki \"FORCED AI service: openai\" dikha\n\n**Agar ye line NAHI dikhi:**\n- Server ne old code load kiya\n- Step 1-3 dobara karo\n\n### Step 6: Patient Process Karo\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000/admin/algorithm-processor\n```\n\n**Ab console mein ye dikhna chahiye:**\n```\n✅ Starting QEEG analysis...\n🔀 Using OpenAI GPT-4 for PDF parsing    ← YE LINE\n🤖 Calling OpenAI GPT-4...\n✅ PDF data extracted successfully\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📸 Mujhe Ye Screenshots Chahiye:\n\n1. **Backend terminal ka full screenshot** - `npm start` ke baad pura output\n2. **Task Manager screenshot** - Node processes kill karne se pehle aur baad mein\n3. **Browser console screenshot** - Patient process karne ke baad\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Agar Abhi Bhi Gemini Error Aaye:\n\n**Ye batao:**\n\n1. Backend terminal mein \"FORCED AI service: openai\" dikha kya?\n2. \"OpenAI Parser loaded successfully\" dikha kya?\n3. Task Manager mein kitne Node processes dikhe?\n4. Port 5000 free tha Step 2 mein?\n\n**Main instantly next solution dunga!**\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Quick Checklist:\n\n- [ ] Task Manager se ALL Node processes kill kiye\n- [ ] Port 5000 free confirm kiya (`netstat` se)\n- [ ] Fresh `npm start` kiya\n- [ ] Console mein \"FORCED AI service: **openai**\" dikha (NOT gemini)\n- [ ] Console mein \"OpenAI Parser loaded\" dikha\n- [ ] Patient upload kiya\n- [ ] Browser console mein \"Using OpenAI GPT-4\" dikha\n\n---\n\n**Pehle Step 1-3 karo (server kill + restart), phir screenshot bhejo!** 🚀"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":90975,"cache_read_input_tokens":16358,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":90975,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1510,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVvfjyD6BYAqM7MCCpRFi","type":"assistant","uuid":"d5379ae2-1f6a-4612-8842-ca18a91dff55","timestamp":"2025-12-09T06:50:59.448Z"}
